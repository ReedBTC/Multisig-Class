Description:

This is an in-person classroom course designed to teach students how to securely setup, use, and completely restore a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet. Before beginning the hands-on portion of the instruction, students will be taught for about 2 hours by the instructor with the assistance of prepared slides, which will be open-sourced and maintained over time. Like any good classroom learning environment, students will be able to ask questions and take notes; however, no videos or pictures will be allowed during any portion of the class. The first portion of the class will cover the following topics:

- Why self-Custody is Important
  - Professional custodians are not as safe as you think
- The Risks of Self-Custody
  - Self-Custody is Responsibility go Up Technology
  - Remote Hacks (e.g., Luke Dashjr)
  - [Documented Physical Attacks](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md)
- Operational Security Basics
- The Difference Between:
  - On-Chain Bitcoin vs. Lightning (high level)
  - Various Mobile Wallets
  - Various Desktop Wallets
  - Various Signing Devices (Hardware Wallets)
  - Single-sig vs. Multi-sig
- Best Practices for Seed Phrase Generation
  - Dice, Coin flips
- Best Practices and Tradeoffs of various seed Phrase Storage Solutions
- Best Practices and Tradeoffs of various Signing Device Storage Solutions and Locations
- Referral Links for Signing Devices

After the lecture portion of the class, each student will be provided with a laptop and 3 different signing devices (hardware wallets), which will all need to be retuned at the end of class and are for classroom use ONLY. Students may NOT use their own computers or their own signing devices during the hands-on portion of the class; this is for instruction and practice ONLY.

During the class we will setup a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet using sparrow, with a cold card, a ledger and a trezor [these three signing devices are commonly used in multi-sig setups and have three different interfaces; other signing devices may be considered in the future].

After successfully setting up their multi-sig wallets, students will fund their wallets and make one on-chain transaction. After securing their three seed phrases and their configuration files, we will then uninstall sparrow and factory reset all three signing devices. Wallets will then be rebuilt using caravan and signing devices will be restored from their seed phrases.

Signing Devices, sealed from the factory, will be physically available for purchase following the class (bitcoin only accepted) and referral links will be shared. On-chain or lightning tips and donations will also be accepted.
